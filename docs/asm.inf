Assembler Routines Listing.
  
Routines Currently supported in assembler for various processors.
Sparc assembler routines soon to be supported.
  
i386+ routines should work on Intel 386/486 and Pentium
processors.

M68k routines should work on M680x0 family processors.
  
Sparc routines should work on most Sparc processors?

All routines are designed to be assembled using the 'as'
assembler that comes with the GNU GCC C/C++ complier and with
most UNIX's.
