Well Heres the stuff I have to do.

*       Add to the basic RSAEURO toolkit a number of new ciphers.
        Currently Only DES in various forms is supported, I would
        like to add RC5, IDEA and maybe others.

*       Improve the Speed of the Hash Functions.

*       Increase the assembler support.

*       User Supplied Key Handling, hash key to common size, etc.

*       Asymmetric Cipher key management.

*       GSS-API
